                           The beginning of Part One 

### 2.1 : CSS and HTML treats with elements when it displays it as the following:

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### 2.2 : We contain elements inside others as the following:

- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

- div elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

### 2.3 : The browsers display each elementas as the following:

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
    - Relative: Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
    - Absolute:When the position property is given a value of absolute , the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page ande elements move in relation to its containing element.
    - Fixed:Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed and elements moves in relation with window and element doesnt move when scrolling.
    - Float : taking element out of normal flow and position it at far point of normal flow and elements becomes block level then we can control overlaping with z index.

### 2.4 : We float elements as the following:

- The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

### 2.5 : We can deal with Screen Sizesas the following:

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

### 2.6 : What the Grids are.
- Grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items which helps to create a professional looking design.

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
