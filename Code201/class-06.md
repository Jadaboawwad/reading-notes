# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM
## 1. Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming
    in this part we will discuss the following points

- How to make the problem familiar.
- Why is problem domains are hard.
- How programming become easy.

                           The beginning of Part One 
                           
## 1.1 problem is being familar by the following:
I am often asked why I keep demonstrating how to build the same simple application over and over again in each of my courses.

What I found with this simple application was that because it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology.

By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.

The same thing happens when writing code.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.


## 1.2 Problem domains are hard because:
The same thing happens when writing code.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.



## 1.3 Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain

The more and more I write code, the more I learn that understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation. It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.

    ### What can you do about it?
    - You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

    - So many developers don’t realize how much of an impact marketing themselves and branding can have on their opportunities.

## 2. Object Literals
    in this part we will discuss the following points

- What is the Object.

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Tow 

###  2.1 : The object is:

- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you .

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names

- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

## 3. Document Object Model
    in this part we will discuss the following points


- How browser represent the page.
- What are types of DOM Tree.

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Three 

### 3.1 : The Browser represent the page as the following:
- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.


### 3.2 : Types of DOM tree are:
DOM trees have four types of nodes: 

- **document** nodes : it represents the entire page.
- **element** nodes : 
    
    - HTML elements describe the structure of an HTML page.
    - You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
    - From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
    - An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
- **attribute** nodes: The opening tags of HTML elements can carry attributes and these are represented by attribute Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within that element.
- **text** nodes :Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within t hat element.
