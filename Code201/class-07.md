### 1.1 The domain modeling is:

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

### 1.2 An example of Domain Modeling:
```html

var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
}

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);

console.log(parkourFail);
console.log(corgiFail);

```

### 2.1 The Table is: 

- The table element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table represents information in a grid format.
- What is the Basic Table Structure.
- How to add a heading for a table.

                           The beginning of Part Tow 

### 2.2 The Basic Structure of table is:


```html

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>45</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>45</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>90</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```

### 2.3 This is how we add headings for a table.


```html

<table>

    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Tickets sold:</th>
        <td>120</td>
        <td>135</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Total sales:</th>
        <td>$600</td>
        <td>$675</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```
