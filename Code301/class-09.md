## 1. Functional Programming Concepts

        in this part we will discuss the following points

        

* What is functional programming?
* What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
* What are the benefits of a pure function?
* What is immutability?
* What is Referential transparency?
<br/>

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### 1.2 : What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

### 1.3 : What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

### 1.4 : What is immutability?

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

### 1.5 : What is Referential transparency?

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## 2. Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is a module?
* What does the word ‘require’ do?
* How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
* What do we have to do to make a module available?

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What is a module?

it's a set of functions and classes that is built to interact with other codes as on unit.

### 2.1: What does the word ‘require’ do?

it import a module from sperate file written to do a functionality in the code

### 2.1: How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

by exporting the file and it will be appeared for others files as module.

### 2.1: What do we have to do to make a module available?

export it ..
