                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is node.js?

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

### 1.2: In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers
It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

### 1.3: What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

* We don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser.

* This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

### 1.4: What is npm?

A package manager that comes bundled with Node.the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1, 000, 000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.

### 1.5: What version of node are you running on your machine?

```javascript
node - v
v14 .17 .1
```

### 1.6: What version of npm are you running on your machine?

```javascript
npm - v
6.14 .13
```

### 1.7: What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

* Installing a Package Globally

```javascript
npm install - g jshint
```

* Installing a Package Locally

```javscript
npm init -y
```

### 1.8: What is node used for?

* installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
* They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

## 2. Reasons for Pair Programming

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
* How does pair programming work?

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency 

        - It’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features.
        - When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.

2. Engaged collaboration

        - When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students

        - If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

4. Social skills

        - When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.

5. Job interview readiness
        -the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills.

6. Work environment readiness 

        - Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.

### 2.2: In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Greater efficiency when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster.

### 2.3: How does pair programming work?

 Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
 
 The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 
 
 The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
