## 1. How I explained REST to my brother

        in this part we will discuss the following points

[Link](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550) : Conversion 
* Who is Roy Fielding 
* Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
*What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* What does a GET do?
* What does a POST do?
* What does PUT do?
* What does PATCH do?

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: Who is Roy Fielding 

The invetor of Machine talk togather Algorithm 

### 1.2: Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

### 1.3 : What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The Machine to Machine communicating Algorithm

### 1.4 : What does a GET do?

when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

### 1.5 : What does a POST do?

Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

### 1.6 : What does PUT do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

### 1.7 : What does PATCH do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
