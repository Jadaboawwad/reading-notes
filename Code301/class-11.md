            The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and * NoSQL databases. 

| SQL                               |  NoSQL                    | 
| ----------------------------------|:-------------------------:|
|Relational Databases               |non-relational database.   |
|table based databases              |document based             |
|predefined schema                  |dynamic schema             |
|vertically scalable                |horizontally scalable      |
|uses structured query language     |use Unstructured Query     |

### 1.2: What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment 

### 1.3:  Give a real world example.

Oracle Express Edition
It is a limited edition of Oracle Enterprise Edition server with certain limitations. This database is free for development and deployment.

### 1.4: What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

### 1.5: Give a real world example.

Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks.

### 1.6: Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? 

 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

### 1.7: Which type of database is best for scalability?

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

## 2. NOSQL vs SQL (Vedio)

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What does SQL stand for?
* What is a realational database?
* What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* What is a ‘schema’?
* What is a NoSQL database?
* Howo does it work?
* What is inside of a Mongo database?
* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
vWhat is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

        The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

### 2.2: What is a realational database?

data base which works with certain assumptions or in certain way and it contain multible table that in relation togather

### 2.3: What type of structure does a relational database work with?

it support the sq language works with tabels

### 2.4: What is a ‘schema’?

strict requirement for data we store which decide the data can go into a table

### 2.5: What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications.

### 2.6: Howo does it work?

it consist of collection insted of tabels and inside of it there is documents which are rows in the tabel we can say and it's look like json files.

### 2.7: What is inside of a Mongo database?

Mongo does't  have to use the same schema and you can have multiple documents in one collection which have diffrent fields and there is no relations between documents

### 2.8: Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB Becuse of:
* less schema
* few relations
* data nested in few collections
* scaled by both hr or ver
* Great performance

### 2.9: What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* it has a few relations
