## 1. Component-Based Architecture:

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is component-Based Architecture?
* What is a Component?
* What is Views of a Component?
* What is Characteristics of Components?
* What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What Component-Based Architecture:

Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties and  It provides a higher level of abstraction and The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability.

### 1.2 What is a Component ?

def : A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

### 1.3 What is Views of a Component?

* Object-oriented view : A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes.

* Conventional view : It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic

* Process-related view : In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is building from existing components maintained in a library. 

### 1.4 What is Characteristics of Components

* Reusability
* Replaceable
* Not context specific
* Extensible
* Encapsulated
* Independent

### 1.5 What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

*  Ease of deployment
* Reduced cost
* Ease of development 
* Reusable
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution
* Independent

## 2. What is Props and How to Use it in React:

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is props short for?
* How are props used in React?
* What is the flow of props?

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1 What is props short for?

“Props” stands for properties. It is a special keyword in React which is used for passing data from one component to another.
 

### 2.2 How are props used in React?

Logically, components are just like JavaScript functions. They accept random inputs (called “props”) and return React elements which tell what should be displayed on the screen.   

* Props are arguments passed into React components.
* Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
* React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
*  Props can be used to pass any kind of data such as:  

    - String
    - Array
    - Integer
    - Boolean
    - Objects
    - Functions
