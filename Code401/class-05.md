### 1.1: Give a prefe description about Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

* Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.
* Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.
* Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.
* Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
* Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency.

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

### 2.2: What is the Terminology of LinkedList

* Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
* Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
* Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
* Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
* Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
* Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
* Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
