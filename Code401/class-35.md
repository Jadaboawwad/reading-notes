- What is the termonology of Graph ?
- What is the Undirected Graph and Directed Graph ?

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is a Graph ?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### 1.2: What is the termonology of Graph ?

- [] Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- [] Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- [] Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- [] Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### 1.3: What is the Undirected Graph and Directed Graph ?

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
