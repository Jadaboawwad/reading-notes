### 1.1: Give a 6 advices for whom going to have a whiteboard interview ?

- Communicate!

Don't step up to the whiteboard and feverishly start solving the problem.
Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for

- Ask About Edge Cases
  It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

- Ask About Test Cases
  This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
  let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.
- Stuck? Ask for Help!
  say “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
- Communicating Prior to the Interview
  You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview.
