                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is Caesar Cipher ?

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

### 1.2: What is the most letter frequent in English?

Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language.

### 1.3 : What is Encryption, decryption, and cracking ?

* Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the * alphabet shift).
* Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
* Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
