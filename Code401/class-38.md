### 1.1: What is Conditional Rendering in React ?

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

### 1.2: Can I use variable to store elements in react ?

You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesnâ€™t change.

### 1.3: What is Inline If with Logical && Operator ?

You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator.
