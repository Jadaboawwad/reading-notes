## 1. Ethics in the workplace


To me, we should think one more time before climbing on doing something in general, even it comes to coding for example. the better way not to give software the absolute authority to operator on its own, but it should always be carefully investigated, when it comes to humanâ€™s health and body because software will always lack other forms of intelligence like emotional intelligence for example. Also, most of the time, when software encounters something that it is not familiar with, it freaks out and might cause detrimental consequences.



## 2. Ethics in Technology

Grow in technology has led to concept called big data this concept held to be a big consuming for resorces, this might be ok, we can exploit this data in a way that can be useful for both the customers and the providers or the sellers when we talk about music industry for example. 
also the concept of metaverse these days become the most common technolgy talking about, If the privacy is not existed this will be a big disaster in the commounity,But when we do not have a predefined schema for our data things get messy, and this data can be exploited for unethical purposes like knowing the race,So organizations have to enforce collecting agreed upon types of data as they also should enforce and restrict the types of applications such types and amounts of data can be used in.
