- Separate settings file for each environment
  This is an extension of the previous approach. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers.
- Environment variables

It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.
