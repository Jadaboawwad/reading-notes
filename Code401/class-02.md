## 1. In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* what is unit test
* what are arrange act and assert

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: what is unit test:

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

### 1.2 : what are arrange act and assert

Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input); 
Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour); 
Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

## 2. If name equals main

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?

Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable.

## 3. Recursion

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is Recursion? 

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Three

### 3.1: What is recursion:

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.
