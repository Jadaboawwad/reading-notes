## 1. How to use Random Module

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is random Module
* When to use random Module
* What are functions of random module

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is random Module

It's a module provide for you an access for functions support many operations
on of them is to generate random numbers

### 1.2 : When to use random Module

* to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list
* to pick a random card from a deck, 

### 1.3 : What are functions of random module

* Randint : accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1, 5. 
* Random : If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.
* Choice : Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
* Shuffle :  shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
* Randrange : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

## 2. What is Risk Analysis

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is Risk and Risk analysis
* Why use Risk Analysis?
* How we deal with Risks?

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: What is Risk?

* Risk : The probability of any unwanted incident is defined

* Risk analysis : The process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

### 2.2: Why use Risk Analysis?

When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

### 2.3: How we deal with Risks?

* Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

* Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

* Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

* Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

## 3. Test Coverage

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is Test Coverage

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Three

### 3.1: What is Test Coverage

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.

is that high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing.

If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s

One sign you are testing too much is if your tests are slowing you down.

It's worth running coverage tools every so often and looking at these bits of untested code.

## 4. Calculate Big O

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What are the four steps of caclulating Big O for code

<br/>

                           The beginning of Part Four

### 4.1: What are the four steps of caclulating Big O for code

<br/>

1. different steps get added
2. Drop Constant
3. Different inputs >> Different variables
4. Drop non-dominate Elements

    

                               The End of Part Four
