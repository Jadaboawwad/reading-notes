## 1. Matplotlib Tutorial

        in this part we will discuss the following points

* What is Ipython?
* What is pyplot ?
* What is Figure?
* What is subplot?
* Waht is axis ?
* What are the kinds of plots?

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is Ipython?

IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and many more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

### 1.2 : What is pyplot ?

pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

### 1.3 : What is Figure ?

A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title. Figures are numbered starting from 1 as opposed to the normal Python way starting from 0. This is clearly MATLAB-style. 

### 1.4 : What is subplot?

With subplot you can arrange plots in a regular grid. You need to specify the number of rows and columns and the number of the plot.

### 1.5 : Waht is axis ?

Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. 

### 1.6 : What are the kinds of plots?

* Regular Plots
* Scatter Plots
* Bar Plots
* Contour Plots
* Imshow
* Pie Charts
* Quiver Plots
* Grids
* Multi Plots
* Polar Axis
* 3D Plots
* Text
