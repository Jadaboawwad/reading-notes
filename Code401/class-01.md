        in this part we will discuss the following points

* Pain and Suffering
* Names and Values in Python

                           The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: Pain and Suffering

What’s My perspective?
In my point of view i was thinking about the people they spend their life setting on chairs and taking their coffee mug in a General place in the city that they are rich 
and they spend their time in worthless things , now i know well that they are developers suffering from bugs and their life is full of challenge , I love challenges and my life need some action in racing the time to deliver the task at the end of the day.

Why are I am doing this?
Life are stages, on of them is to learn but this stage never end for me ..
reading are the most time i spend in my life and using computer at most the of this time
must be helpful in gethering money to start building my life for better future or maybe a
good family.

Do I want what comes at the end of this journey?
I promise my slef that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch, i need to improve my
skills and make my mind grow every day until i reach my goal.

Are I doing this for Myslef?
If say that i will be selfish but thats right, think of your self to build a better life
for others and think in others to build a better life for yourself.

                           The beginning of Part Tow

### 2.1: Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match, it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element, it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.

This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). 

### 2.2: A friendly intro to Big O Notation

If we want to talk about data structures types like stack, linked list or array we need to detect the performance of implementation (size of data space, time of process).

The linked list is hard to search in but it easy to insert to , from the beginning or the end both are constant time.

The Array is hard to insert to because you have to clone the array and then you can insert to it by considering that the index should be updated wich cost time in linear form.

The Stack is efficient way when the size of data will not be considered when you move between the web pages for example or when you copy or past things.
