### 1.1: What is React context?

React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

### 1.2: When should you use React context?

React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

### 1.3: What problems does React context solve?

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

### 1.4: How do I use React context?

- Create context using the createContext method.
- Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
- Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
- Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.

### 1.5: Does React context replace Redux?

For many React beginners, Redux is a way of more easily passing around data. This is because Redux comes with React context itself.
