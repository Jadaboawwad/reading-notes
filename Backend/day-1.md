# 1. RESTful API

                 in this part we will discuss the following points

### 1.1 What is REST ?

### 1.2 What are guiding principles to REST ?

### 1.3 What is the resource and resource method?

### 1.4 Give a summary for RESTful API at all.

                              The beginning of Part One

### 1.1: What is REST ?

It is an acronym fpr representational state transfer and architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems made by Royfielding, where hypermedia is a non-linear medium of information like graphics audio, video, text and hyperlinks.
Web API conforming to REST Architectural is REST API.

### 1.2: What are guiding principles to REST

- Uniform interface : applies generally to the component interface where the generality means the separation of concerns, to simplify architecture and visibility interactions by:

- Identification of resources.
  Manipulation of resources.

- Self descriptive of resources.
  Hypermedia is the engine of app state.

- Client Server Model : design pattern on freces separation of concerns and improve portability and scalability,

- Stateless : each request from the client to server must contain all information necessary to understand the complete request.

- Cacheable : response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non cacheable.
- Layered systems : allows composition of hierarchical layers.

### 1.3: What is the resource and resource method?

It is a key abstraction of information in REST, where a state of resource at a particular time is resource representation.
resource method is a way to perform the desired transaction between two states of any resources.

Note here that REST and http are not the same.

### 1.4: Give a summary for RESTful API at all .

Architectural style , data and functionality are considered where resources are accessed using uniform resource identifiers, acts by set of well defined operations, client amd server exchange represntations of resource by using a standerized interface protocol called HTTP
